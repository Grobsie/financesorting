## Goal
a program which can assign bank statements to categories to get a better overview of spendings

the program would have a few capabilities:
- upload banking details to a mariadb instance (from .csv file)
- auto assign up to two catogories based on a reference list (JSON)
- manually assign tags
- have the ability to add new tags to the reference list

once the data has been categorized the following step would be to make a web app to visualize the data

## checklist
- retagging has been done in DB (added additional tag)
- whole dasboard should now be revisited to make it work with three tags

- upload CSV file on dashboard, followed by autotagging
